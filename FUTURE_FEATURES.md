# Ideas for the application

- add a function to delete all tasks (specify that the user can use the keyword -all to delete all files, and require confirmation)
    - basically, have in the menu the option -d :delete a task (d - all to delete all tasks)
    - if the user enters d -all, require an explicit yes to delete all tasks

- shortened menu to be displayed after the inital menu, written like this

a -add a task   c -complete a task  d -delete a task (d -all)   v -view all tasks
s -export       x -exit
